# parking_sensor

This parking assistant is a good way to avoid running into the stuff you're storing in your garage. It indicates to the user how much room they have left when they are pulling into their space with their car.

The ping sensors aren't waterproof, so don't put them in a place where they will get wet.

It's possible to make multiple instances of this hardware to get distances from multiple sides. The sonar ping devices have different max ranges based on individual hardware, but most of them will handle the 100cm max range specified in this project.
